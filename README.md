# jquery-tastyworksmod
Cleans up the trade.tastyworks.com website using a simple bookmarklet or chrome extension.

1. Removes the left most side bar
1. Removes the Home, Follow, Journal, and TastyTrade links
1. Makes the screen full  width

You can see the very simple code by looking at the code.js file. If you want to remove pieces of my code simply edit the file and turn it into a bookmarklet/extension yourself using the sites in the credits section.

## Bookmarklet ##
Visit the page below for the working link that you can right click and copy the code, or even better, drag to your bookmarks bar:
https://thorst.github.io/jquery-tastyworksmod/

## Chrome Extension ##
This will run the code automatically when you visit trade.tastyworks.com

Instructions
1. Download and Unzip "Tastyworks Mod Chrome Extension" folder.
1. Go to extensions settings: Menu » More tools » Extensions
1. Tick "Developer mode" (top right).
1. Click "Load unpacked extension..." and select unzipped folder. OR drag the folder onto chromes extension page
